<h4 align = "right">Hi, my name is Ayenuyo Ayobami, an aspiring Data Scientist currently studying as an undergraduate in<br> Kwara State University. From my teen, I had always loved anything that had to do with the computer. <br>At a point in my life, I did some research about what the computer can be used for and then I came<br>across programming languages. During  my course of research, I discovered that there are aspects<br> in programming languages and they all looked fascinating to me then. Confused on what aspect<br> to delve into, I did some critical thinking about my passions and interest and later committed<br> to learning everything about Data Science because I had always loved anything that had<br> with data. Do you want to work together? Please reach out to me by e-mail.</h4>
